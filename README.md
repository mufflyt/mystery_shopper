OBJECTIVE:  To evaluate the mean appointment wait time for a new patient visit at outpatient female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery offices for US women with the common and non-emergent complaint of uterine prolapse.
 
METHODS:  The American Urogynecologic Society “Find a Provider” tool was used to generate a list of female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery (FPMRS) offices across the United States.  Each of the 427 unique listed offices was called. The caller asked for the soonest appointment available for her mother, who was recently diagnosed with uterine prolapse.  Data for each office were collected including date of soonest appointment, FPMRS physician demographics, and office demographics.  Mean appointment wait time was calculated.  
 
RESULTS:  Four hundred twenty-seven FPMRS offices were called in 46 states plus the District of Columbia.  The mean appointment wait time was 23.1 business days for an appointment (standard deviation 19 business days).  The appointment wait time was six days longer when seeing a female FPMRS physician compared to a male FPMRS physician (mean 26 vs. 20 business days, p<0.02).  There was no difference in wait time by day of the week called. 
 
CONCLUSION:  Typically, a woman with uterine prolapse can expect to wait at least four weeks for a new patient appointment with an FPMRS board certified physician listed on the American Urogynecologic Society website.  First available appointment is more often with a male physician.  A patient can expect to wait six days longer to see a female FPMRS physician.

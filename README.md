OBJECTIVE:  To estimate the median wait times for US women with the common and non-emergent complaint of uterine prolapse.
 
METHODS:  The American Urogynecologic Society “Find a Provider” tool was used to generate a list of female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery (FPMRS) offices across the United States. Each of the 417 unique offices was called once. The caller asked for the soonest appointment available for her mother, who was recently diagnosed with uterine prolapse. Data collected included date of soonest appointment, FPMRS physician demographics and telephone staff demographics. Using R, the number of business days until the next available appointment was calculated for each office. No appointments were scheduled. 
 
RESULTS:  Four hundred seventeen FPMRS offices were called in 46 states.  The median wait time was 17 business days for an appointment (range 0-96 business days).  The wait time to see a female FPMRS physician was five days longer than a male FPMRS physician (median 25.4 vs. 20.2 business days, p<0.001).  There was no difference in terms of geographic region, day of the week called, or the gender of the receptionist answering the phone. 
 
CONCLUSION:  Typically, a woman with uterine prolapse can expect to wait two to three weeks for a new patient appointment with an FPMRS board certified physician. A patient can expect to wait five days longer to see a female FPMRS provider.
